# DiceRoller
Dice roller for D&amp;D, first project.

Hello there
It's my first project with using JavaScript, dont kick me so strong :)
Easy to use: just choose number of dices that u wanna roll, choose modificators from your stats and mastery and click button like D20.
Your results will be execute in column.
Your critical throws at D20 will be alerted, but all thrown 1's at all dices will be shown for you (will fix it later)

TY for reading, have a nice day :)
